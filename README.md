# AngularJS-Web-App-Skeleton
All you need to start an angular app. Just start filling in your information.

Note: For a multi-view one page application, none of your code should go in the index.html

The different views should be in seperate html files that are the same name as your the html files specified in your routes (which can be found at the bottom of the app.js)
